There are tons of ways to get involved with Wash, whether or not you're a programmer!

- Come and hang out with us on [slack](https://puppetcommunity.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=wash)! Feel free to ask questions, answer questions from other folks, or just lurk. Come and talk to us about things about modern infra you find [complex or infuriating](https://landscape.cncf.io/), or what your [favorite hacking movie scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1ds9ceg-vy) are, or the [best monospaced font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/inconsolata). 

- Have something cool that you'd like connect up to wash? we'd love to hear your ideas, and help you figure out how to do it! We don't care if you want wash to talk to a network device, a smart lightbulb, your bluetooth-enabled espresso scale, or just more types of resources from cloud providers. 

- Are you an artist? Design some wash-related artwork or a logo, and we'll see about putting it into the rotation for the site!

- Are you an old skool command-line gearhead with, like, *opinions* about how things should work on a command line? We'd love your help figuring out how the shell experience for wash should work. how can our unixy wash commands behave better? Are there new commands we should build? What colors and formatting should we use for `wash ls`? If we implemented `wash fortune`, what quotes should be in there?!

- Did you script something cool that uses wash under the hood? Please let us know, and how we can help!

- Can you sling html, or markdown? this site is built using hugo, and the source is in our [github repo](https://github.com/puppetlabs/wash/tree/master/website). We'd love help documenting stuff!

- Did you give a talk or presentation on wash? Give us the link, so we can help promote it!
