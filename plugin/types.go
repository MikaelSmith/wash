/*
Package plugin defines a set of interfaces that plugins must implement to enable wash
functonality.

All resources must implement the Entry interface. To do so they should include the EntryBase
type, and initialize it via NewEntry. For example
	type myResource struct {
		plugin.EntryBase
	}
	...
	rsc := myResource{plugin.NewEntry("a resource")}
EntryBase gives the resource a name - which is how it will be displayed in the filesystem
or referenced via the API - and tools for controlling how its data is cached.

The Group interface identifies the resource as a container for other things. Implementing it
enables displaying it as a directory in the filesystem. Anything that does not implement
Group will be displayed as a file.

The Readable interface gives a file its contents when read via the filesystem.

All of the above, as well as other types - Resource, Execable, Pipe - provide
additional functionality via the HTTP API.
